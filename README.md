# Cosmic Explorer:Unveiling The Universe

## Problem Statement:
In today's age of space exploration and scientific discovery, there exists a wealth of data
and imagery collected by NASA from various missions, satellites, telescopes, and other
scientific instruments. However, accessing and comprehending this vast amount of
space-related data can be challenging for individuals, educators, researchers, and
students. There is a need for a centralized platform that provides easy access to
NASA's space data and facilitates its visualization in an intuitive and informative
manner.

## Solution:
Cosmic Explorer: Unveiling the Universe presents a solution to the accessibility and
comprehension challenges inherent in NASA's space-related data. This single-page
HTML/ CSS/ JavaScript front-end application accesses data from public APIs provided
by NASA, enabling users to explore and visualize space data seamlessly without
redirects or reloads. Offering a user-friendly interface, Cosmic Explorer empowers users
to delve into real-time satellite imagery, weather and climate data visualizations, insights
into exoplanets and celestial objects for space science and exploration.

## Team:
Front-end, APIs & json-server.

## MVP Features:
1. Real-Time Satellite Imagery
The user should be able to access and explore real-time satellite imagery of
Earth captured by NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) satellites.
2. Weather and Climate Data Visualizations
The application should provide a visualization of weather patterns, climate data,
and environmental changes, utilizing data from NASA&'s Global Imagery Browse
Services or Worldview API.
3. Astronomy Picture of the Day
The user should be able to view and share the latest astronomy picture or video
accompanied by a brief explanation provided by NASA.
4. Exoplanet Data Visualization
The user should be able to explore data on exoplanets discovered by NASA&#39;s
missions, including information on their properties, discovery methods, and
orbital parameters.

## Technical Expectations:
- Front-end: Single-page HTML/ CSS/ JavaScript front-end application
- Data Access: Access data from public APIs provided by NASA
- API Integration: Utilize NASA APIs
- JSON Server: Serve data from a db.json file using json-server#
